# HTML-and-CSS-projects
This is a display of sample websites I made using HTML and CSS. 

<h1>Projects</h1>
  <p><ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vransom/HTML-and-CSS-projects/blob/main/Space%20Station%20Project/Index.html">Space Station Site</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vransom/HTML-and-CSS-projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html"> Movie Theater Site</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vransom/HTML-and-CSS-projects/blob/main/One-Page%20Website/one_page_website.html">One-Page Website</li>
  </ul></p>

<h2>Space Station Site</h2>
<p> All of the coding techniques were learned by watching my instructor's videos, but I decided to make this site about my dogs as well as my friend's dogs. Looking at their cute smiling faces was a welcome change from coding at some points. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.</p>

<h2>Movie Theater Site</h2>
<p>This is an example for a Movie Theater styled using Bootstrap4. I really enjoyed learning how to use the Bootstrap elements. It uses techniques like jumptron, a navbar, form, cards, and dropdowns.</p>

<h3>One Page Website</h3>
<p>This was another project we worked on to practice using HTML and CSS. I decided to created it based on a previous trip to Miami that I took. It contains imbedded pictures and videos, as well as a subscription form and some CSS styling</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>There are many other drills located in this repository, however the three above are the ones that I am most proud of. Can't wait to learn more!</p>
